                            My resume will paint a picture of a person who is in a career transition, a Software developer, and a Veteran.<br><br>
                            But the truth is, I’m much more than that - I’m an innovator, an entrepreneur, a creator, and a soul searcher. I am the person who would come up with a hundred ways of how not to do something, but when it comes down to it I am that person that will not give up until I can find the perfect way to come up with the perfect answer.<br><br>
                            I’m a true believer that imagination is more important than knowledge.<br><br>
                            As humans we feel knowledge is everything; but, knowledge is limited. Whereas imagination embraces the world, inspire progress, and gives birth to evolution.<br><br>
                            And so I work hard to always let my imagination inspire my knowledge. I am always seeking ways to collaborate, improve upon, and explore new concepts, also helping build a Web presence from the ground up.<br><br>
                            Specialties include: Python, Pandas, Django, Spring Framework, RESTful web services, Java, MySQL, Tomcat, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, Bootstrap, and GitHub.<br><br>
                            I welcome the chance to connect with you and talk more about any and all things.
